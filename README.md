# My Notebooks

ðŸ““ A repository of notebooks and guides for various tools, technologies, and projects. All public of course ðŸ˜‰

## Getting Started

The following items are what I use to create and run these notebooks. You can use whatever you like, but I can recommend the following:

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- VS Code extensions:
  - [Polyglot Notebooks (Microsoft)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) - use multiple languages in one notebook with full language server support for each language and share variables between them.
  - [Jupyter Notebook Renderers (Microsoft)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter-renderers) - renderers for Jupyter Notebooks (with plotly, vega, gif, png, svg, jpeg and other such outputs).
